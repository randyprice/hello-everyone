Hello, everyone!

Adding peronal projects to my github soon! Just need to clean them up a bit first.

Be on the lookout for:
  - A recreation of the popular board game "HEAT," playable in the terminal (~1 week)
  - An NHL season simulator (~2 weeks)
  - A remake of the first personal project I ever completed - a short text-based adventure game
    called "an endless sea" (~4 weeks)
